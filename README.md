# mod-rotation

*[Version française : README_FR.md](README_FR.md)*

AzerothCore module (compatible with the **liyunfan1223/azerothcore-wotlk**
fork, Playerbot branch): a one-button rotation triggered by a spell placed on
the action bar. **1 press = 1 action** — each press casts the highest-priority
ability currently available.

**All 10 classes and 30 specializations** are covered. The specialization is
detected automatically (dominant talent tree), rotations follow the Wowhead
WotLK Classic guides, and the module resolves the **highest known rank** of
every spell: it works at every level, not just 80.

## Testing status

⚠️ **Only a few classes have been tested at high level** so far (notably Fury
Warrior). All other specializations are implemented from the Wowhead guides
but have not been battle-tested yet — bug reports and fixes are very welcome
(see Contributing below).

## Contributing

**Please submit any modification of this module as a pull request to this
repository**, so that fixes and improvements benefit everyone instead of
diverging across private forks.

Note: this is the project's contribution policy, not a license term — the
GPL-2.0 license legally permits forks and modified copies (source disclosure
is only required when distributing binaries). A pull request here is simply
the friendly way to share improvements with the community.

## The trigger spell

Default: **47322 "Dragonblight Test Spell 02"**, an unused Blizzard test spell
present in the 3.3.5a client `Spell.dbc`: instant, no cost, no cooldown, no
GCD, a single harmless *Dummy* effect. Every player learns it on login
(`Rotation.AutoLearn = 1`).

Renaming it to "Rotation" (and changing its icon) is done client-side with a
small MPQ patch: edit the name of spell 47322 in `DBFilesClient\Spell.dbc`
(WDBX Editor, stoneharry's Spell Editor…) and ship the file in a
`patch-4.MPQ` / `patch-enUS-4.MPQ`. Purely cosmetic: the module works without
it. The spell ID can be changed in the config (`Rotation.SpellId`) without
recompiling.

## Implemented rotations

General rules: power costs (mana/rage/energy/runes), cooldowns, GCD and range
are checked before every cast — if an ability is unavailable, the next one in
the list is tried. "AoE" = at least `Rotation.AoE.Threshold` enemies in combat
within `Rotation.AoE.Radius` yards **of your current target** (default: 2
enemies within 10 yards) — counting around the target rather than around
yourself is what makes AoE work for ranged specs and for non-tank group
members. Healers heal the **selected friendly target** (or
themselves) according to the `Rotation.Heal.*` thresholds, and deal light
damage when nobody is injured.

## Installation

1. Copy the `mod-rotation` folder into the server sources' `modules/`
   directory (next to `mod-playerbots`).
2. Re-run CMake, then rebuild.
3. (Optional) Customize `configs/modules/mod_rotation.conf`; reloadable
   in-game with `.reload config`.

No SQL required.

## Code structure

- [src/Rotation.h](src/Rotation.h) / [src/Rotation.cpp](src/Rotation.cpp) —
  configuration, trigger-spell interception (`OnPlayerSpellCast`, deferred by
  one update tick), helpers (`TryCastRank`, `KeepAuraOn`, highest known
  rank…) and class/spec dispatch (`GetMostPointsTalentTree`).
- `src/Rotation<Class>.cpp` — one file per class, one function per
  specialization: this is where priorities are tuned.
- `src/mod_rotation_loader.cpp` — module system entry point.

## Known limitations

- Totems (Shaman), long-duration buffs (Fortitude, Power Word…) and major
  offensive cooldowns (Recklessness, Metamorphosis, Avenging Wrath…) are not
  automated — by design, these decisions are left to the player.
- Positional/tool-dependent abilities (Shred behind the target, Mutilate with
  two daggers, Envenom with a poison up…) fail silently when their
  requirement is not met; a fallback is always tried.
- Ground-targeted spells (Blizzard, Volley, Death and Decay…) are centered on
  the target.
